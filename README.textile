h1. Welcome to Nebula

Nebula is an issue tracking system for the Council of Stellar Management, the player-elected stakeholder in EVE Online.

Issues here refer to problems, feature requests or other topics to be put forward to the CSM for consideration, who can then decide to take the proposal to CCP at a meeting.

h2. Development

Nebula is openly developed and planned. The requirements for developing Nebula are:

 * Ruby 1.9.1 (recommended; should work with 1.8.7)
 * Rails 2.3.8
 * Linux/OSX development environments

We will be using test driven development and continuous integration to ensure that we write a tool that performs to the spec we come up with through discussing with the CSM.

Continuous integration will help ensure that no errors creep in before deploying the system to production.

h2. Getting Involved

It is highly recommended to join irc.coldfront.net #eve-dev and catch the devs in there to discuss getting involved before you just dive in. However, all are welcome to do so as long as they are vaugely technically competent :-)
